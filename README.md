  <h1>Microservices in NodeJS</h1>
</div> 

These are several basic microservices that can be reused in small projects (this can also be used for learning). In this project, I have five microservices to offer : 

1. A [filemetadata](https://github.com/WillN-Git/NodeJS-microservices/tree/main/Filemetadata)
2. An [URL shortener](https://github.com/WillN-Git/NodeJS-microservices/tree/main/URLShortener)
3. A [Header parser](https://github.com/WillN-Git/NodeJS-microservices/tree/main/HeaderParser)
4. A [Timestamp](https://github.com/WillN-Git/NodeJS-microservices/tree/main/Timestamp)
5. An [exercise tracker](https://github.com/WillN-Git/NodeJS-microservices/tree/main/ExerciseTracker)
