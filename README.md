  <h1>Microservices in NodeJS</h1>
</div> 

These are several basic microservices that can be reused in small projects (this can also be used for learning). In this project, I have five microservices to offer : 

1. A filemetadata
2. An URL shortener
3. A Header parser
4. A Timestamp
5. An exercise tracker
